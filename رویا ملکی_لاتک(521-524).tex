\textbf{Hints:}

\vspace*{0.1cm}
1. From a regular grammar, FA can be designed. It can be tested whether two FA are equivalent
or not.\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}
3. A given CFG is infinite if there is at least one cycle in the directed graph generated from the
production rules of the given CFG in CNF.\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}
4. The problem is undecidable. But if the state is the beginning state, it must be traversed. Thus, it is
partially decidable.\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}
8. The complement of a recursively enumerable language is not recursively enumerable.\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}
9. $L = 5n + 2$ but $L \neq 7n + 4$. Hence, we can design a machine which halts and accepts if $L = 5n + 2$
and halts and rejects if $L \neq 7n + 4$. So, it is decidable.\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}
10. $L _{1}$ and $L _{2}$ are recursive. The intersection of two recursive languages is recursive. But the intersection
of the recursive and the recursively enumerable languages are recursively enumerable and
not recursive.\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}

12. A DPDA can be designed which PUSH X for each appearance of ‘0’. No stack operation for
traversing 2 and POP X for ‘1’. A Turing machine can be designed for it where for each ‘0’ it
traverses the rightmost ‘1’ by replacing them by X and Y, respectively. If after X, 2 appears and
after 2, Y appears, then it halts. Thus, it is recursive.\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}

13. The intersection of two regular language is regular, i.e., CFL. Using $Q3$, we can find infiniteness.\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}

16. The size of the $L _{1}$ set is less than the size of the $L _{3}$ set.\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}

17. Two languages are CFL. The intersection of the two CFL is not a CFL, so not regular. (b and c are
false). The answer will be ‘a’ or ‘d’.\\
